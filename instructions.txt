I. OBJECTIVES
Write a program to simulate the non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find
turnaround time and waiting time for the above problem using FCFS.

II. DISCUSSION
CPU Scheduling maybe classified as non-preemptive and preemptive. Non-
preemptive scheduling is where the CPU cannot be taken away from its currently
executing process. While the preemptive scheduling is when the CPU can be taken
away from its currently executing process

Related Terms
1. Turn-Around time - the time between the point a process is submitted and
the time it finishes executing
2. Waiting time – the time a process has to spend inside the ready queue
waiting to be executed by the CPU
3. FCFS – First come first serve. It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm
wherein the one that enters the ready queue first gets to be executed by the
CPU first.

IV. METHODOLOGY
1. Let the user enter the no of process. Valid no of process is from 3-10 only.
2. Enter the process ID, arrival time and the burst time based on the number of process
the user wants to compute
3. Then calculate and display the waiting time, turnaround time, average waiting time and
average turn-around time of the process accordingly.
4. Provide all possible validations.

V. SAMPLE OUTPUT
Enter the no. of process: 5
Enter process ID for Process1: P1
Enter process ID for Process2: P2
Enter process ID for Process3: P3
Enter process ID for Process4: P4
Enter process ID for Process5: P5
Enter waiting time for P1: 2
Enter waiting time for P2: 0
Enter waiting time for P3: 3
Enter waiting time for P4: 9
Enter waiting time for P5: 6
Enter burst time for P1: 8
Enter burst time for P2: 4
Enter burst time for P3: 2
Enter burst time for P4: 5
Enter burst time for P5: 7                       
Average waiting: 6.2
Average turn-around time: 11.4
